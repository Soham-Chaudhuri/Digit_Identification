# CNN Based Digit Recognizer 

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. It's implemented using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Project Description

The MNIST dataset is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training and testing in the field of machine learning. This project utilizes a CNN, a class of deep learning neural networks, which are most commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery.

Our CNN model is built and trained using TensorFlow and Keras libraries in Python. It classifies the handwritten digits into one of the 10 classes (0 to 9).

## Installation 

This project requires Python and the following Python libraries installed:

- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included.

To install the requirements with pip, run the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Usage

After you clone this repo to your desktop, go to its root directory and run the script to start the application.
